/// Small, self-contained responsive utilities for `dreamic` — a zero
/// third-party-dependency replacement for the thin slice of
/// `responsive_framework` the app actually used (device-class detection and
/// "pick a value by breakpoint").
///
/// ## The split: structure vs dimensions
///
/// This file exposes **two** reactivity models. Keeping them straight is the
/// whole point of the API surface, so it is the first thing documented:
///
/// - **Breakpoints for structure** — *which* layout (one column vs two,
///   show/hide a panel). Read via [ResponsiveContext.deviceSize] /
///   [ResponsiveContext.responsive]. These resolve the **[ResponsiveScope]'s
///   whole-window device class** and rebuild dependents **only when the class
///   flips** (segment-only rebuilds), never on every pixel of a resize.
///
/// - **Interpolation for dimensions** — font size, spacing, gaps, max content
///   width. Read via [ResponsiveContext.clampByViewportWidth] /
///   [ResponsiveContext.responsiveByViewportWidth]. These read the **nearest
///   [MediaQuery] width at the call site** (the whole window normally, or a
///   sized sub-region under a deliberately nested [MediaQuery]) and rebuild
///   **per-pixel**, by design.
///
/// The `Viewport` qualifier on the width helpers marks "tracks the local width
/// *here*, not the device class" — so the two models can never be confused at a
/// call site. A consequence of this split: the width helpers read [MediaQuery]
/// directly and therefore need only a [MediaQuery] ancestor — **not** a
/// [ResponsiveScope] — whereas the class-based accessors throw a [FlutterError]
/// without a scope (see [ResponsiveScope] and [_ResponsiveData]).
///
/// ## Configuration
///
/// Set [Breakpoints] once at startup before `runApp`, then wrap the app in a
/// single [ResponsiveScope] (top-level, above `MaterialApp`, is supported).
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// void main() {
///   // Configure once, before runApp (optional — defaults are 600 / 1024).
///   Breakpoints.tablet = 600;
///   Breakpoints.desktop = 1024;
///   runApp(const ResponsiveScope(child: MyApp()));
/// }
///
/// class HomeBody extends StatelessWidget {
///   const HomeBody({super.key});
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     // Structure: pick a layout by device class (segment-only rebuilds).
///     final columns = context.responsive<int>(mobile: 1, tablet: 2, desktop: 3);
///
///     // Dimensions: interpolate by call-site viewport width (per-pixel).
///     final gutter = context.clampByViewportWidth(minValue: 12, maxValue: 32);
///     final maxContentWidth = context.responsiveByViewportWidth<double>(
///       breakpoints: {0: 480, 600: 720, 1024: 960},
///       fallback: 480,
///     );
///
///     return GridView.count(
///       crossAxisCount: columns,
///       padding: EdgeInsets.all(gutter),
///       children: [/* ... constrained to maxContentWidth ... */],
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```

/// Flutter-SDK-only.

/// - [DevicePlatform] — the **operating system** (iOS / Android / web / macOS /
///   Windows / Linux). For "is this a phone OS?" use `DevicePlatform`, not
///   `DeviceSize`.
/// - `DeviceFormFactor` — the **physical device form factor** (phone / tablet /
///   desktop / browser), used server-side for notification-delivery
///   prioritization and **not** barrel-exported. It shares the `tablet` /
///   `desktop` names with `DeviceSize` (and `phone` ≈ `mobile`), but it
///   describes the hardware, whereas `DeviceSize` describes the **current
///   window width**.

///
/// ```dart
/// void main() {
///   Breakpoints.tablet = 700;
///   Breakpoints.desktop = 1200;
///   runApp(const ResponsiveScope(child: MyApp()));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// These are process-global mutable statics; there is no per-call

/// silently misclassifies. There is **no runtime guard** for this, by
/// minimalism — a misconfiguration is a startup error that is immediately
